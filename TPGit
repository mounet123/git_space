1 er ligne master1
-----------------------------------
Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
